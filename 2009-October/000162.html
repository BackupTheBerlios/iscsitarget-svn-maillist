+               Release Notes for iSCSI Enterprise Target
+               =========================================
+
+                           October 5th, 2009
+                             Version 1.4.18
+                             --------------
+
+The IET development team is pleased to announce the release of version
+1.4.18 of the iSCSI Enterprise Target.
+
+This release includes numerous bug fixes and compatibility improvements
+and it is highly recommended that all production servers be on this
+version for compatibility and stability reasons.
+
+The version numbering of IET has changed in this release from the 0.X.X
+series to the 1.X.X series. We did this because we felt that, since IET
+has been stable and in production use for many years now, it deserved a
+version number that better reflected that stability and maturity. We
+are preserving the minor/maintenance numbers though in order to help
+maintain some consistency between prior and future releases.
+
+We would like to thank all those that contributed for this release. As
+we are a small project we rely heavily on user contributions and we
+welcome all who wish to participate in improving IET.
+
+New since 0.4.17:
+
+- Added support for recent kernel versions up to 2.6.31
+- Added support for even more targets via:
+	* multi PDU support during discovery
+	* improved procfs support
+	* global thread pool (module parameter)
+- Added support to list all target addresses during discovery, with
+  the ability to filter those addresses via targets.allow
+- Replaced initiators.deny with an implicit deny on a failure to find
+  a match in initiators.allow while preserving backwards compatiblity
+  with existing installations (iff initiators.deny doesn't exist)
+- Added ability to filter initiators by their IQNs as well as their
+  IP addresses, using basic regex pattern to specify IQNs
+- Moved the config files to /etc/iet/ while preserving backwards
+  compatiblity with existing installations (iff a valid config file
+  exists in the new location will it be used)
+- Added support for Unit Attention Conditions
+	* SCSI RESERVE/RELEASE now issues a UAC on reservation loss
+- Added support for DKMS and building RPM packages right from the
+  source archive (from either the source tar ball or subversion)
+
+Plus many many bug and compatibility fixes (see ChangeLog for details)
+
+
+Special thanks go to:
+
+Shreyansh Jain, Lars Ellenberg, Ming Zhang, Francois Micaux, Cheng Renquan,
+Andreas Florath, sdrb, Xie Gang, Stefan Rubner, FUJITA Tomonori, and to all
+list members who submitted bug reports, suggestions and comments.
+
+Without whose contributions this release would not have been possible.
+
+Arne Redlich &amp; Ross Walker
